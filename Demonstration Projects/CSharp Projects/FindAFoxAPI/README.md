# This application uses the native HttpClient library to request a URL to a random picture
# of a fox from the 'RandomFox' API and then opens that URL in the user's default web browser.

# RandomFox is a public online API that does not require any Auth/apiKey and does not need to be
# supplied with any request data.

# This application was built to target the .NET Framework
